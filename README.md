Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms using Python.

1. Linear Regression
A supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable by modeling the linear relationship between input features and the output.

2. Logistic Regression
A classification algorithm used for binary outcomes. It models the probability of the target variable belonging to a particular class using a logistic function.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

4. Decision Tree
A tree-structured algorithm used for both classification and regression. It splits data into branches based on feature values to make predictions.

5. Random Forest
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their results to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

6. Gradient Boosting
A boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, where each model corrects the errors of the previous one. It is commonly used for both classification and regression tasks.

7. AdaBoost
An ensemble learning technique that improves the accuracy of weak classifiers by focusing on instances that previous classifiers misclassified.

8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.

9. Voting Classifier
An ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM) and uses majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression) to make the final prediction.

10. Bagging Classifier
An ensemble technique where multiple instances of the same model (e.g., decision trees) are trained on different subsets of the data (created using bootstrapping), and their predictions are aggregated to improve accuracy and reduce variance.
